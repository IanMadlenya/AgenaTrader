#AgenaTrader Scripts 
This project contains scripts for the agenatrader like indicators, conditions and strategies. Feel free to use these scripts. if you have feedback please send us a short message or open an issue on GitHub.

##Important
To compile indicators, conditions and other script resources without any error your Agena Trader also need access to the utility indicator to use these global source code elements. You need to copy the Utility Indicator into the indicators directory of your agena trader. You will find this indicator on GitHub: [Global Utilities](https://github.com/simonpucher/AgenaTrader/blob/master/Utility/GlobalUtilities_Utility.cs)
