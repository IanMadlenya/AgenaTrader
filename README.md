#AgenaTrader Scripts 
This project contains scripts for the AgenaTrader like indicators, conditions and strategies. If you have feedback please just send us a short message, an email or open an issue on GitHub.

##Important
###Code access to Utility Indicator
To compile indicators, conditions and other script resources without any error **your AgenaTrader also need access to the utility indicator** to use global source code elements. We use this utility indicator to share code snippets, so we do not need to copy and paste again and again (reduces error sources, reduce workload, better testing opportunities, better clarity and so on).

###How can i do this?
You need to copy the Utility Indicator into the indicators directory of your agena trader. You will find this indicator on GitHub: [Global Utilities](https://github.com/simonpucher/AgenaTrader/blob/master/Utility/GlobalUtilities_Utility.cs)
