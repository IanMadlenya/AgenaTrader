#AgenaTrader Scripts 
This project contains scripts for the AgenaTrader like indicators, conditions and strategies. If you have feedback please just send us a short message, an email or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/simonpucher/AgenaTrader/issues).

##Important
###Code access to Utility Indicator
To compile indicators, conditions and other script resources without any error **your AgenaTrader also need access to the utility indicator** to use global source code elements! 

###Why we use the Utility Indicator
We use this indicator to share code snippets, so we do not need to copy and paste again and again. These reduces error sources, minimze the workload, gives us better testing opportunities and a better clarity.

###How can I do this?
You need to copy the Utility Indicator into the indicators directory of your AgenaTrader. You will find the latest version of this Utility Indicator on GitHub: [Global Utilities](https://github.com/simonpucher/AgenaTrader/blob/master/Utility/GlobalUtilities_Utility.cs)
