#Strategies for Agena Trader

##Important
To compile indicators, conditions and other script resources without any error your Agena Trader also need access to the utility indicator to use these global source code elements. You will find this indicator on GitHub: [Global Utilities](https://github.com/simonpucher/AgenaTrader/blob/master/Utility/GlobalUtilities_Utility.cs)

##Open Range
The initial version of this strategy was inspired by the work of Birger Schäfermeier: [ORB by Birger Schäfermeier](https://www.whselfinvest.at/de/Store_Birger_Schaefermeier_Trading_Strategie_Open_Range_Break_Out.php)
